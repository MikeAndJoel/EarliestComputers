        <p align="center">The Difference Engine was created by inventor and polymath, Charles Babbage (born December 1791 died October 1871),<br>and Ada Lovelace (born December 1815 died November 1852).
            <br>It is an 'automatic mechanical calculator designed to tabulate polynomial functions'.<br><br>The engine was constructed from the frustration that the human computational mind was far from perfect,<br> and that the world was in need of
            something that would calculate anything perfectly.

            <br> <img src="differenceengine.png" /><br> Babbage's Difference engine was one of the first ever recognised computers however it is not an electronic computer and it does not have a screen. It is a mechanical calculator that can work out
            more advanced and higher quantity calculations than a normal calculator today.<br> Babbage approached the project very seriously. Charles Babbage was not an engineer, but a mathematician - so he planned and drew the design and a quality mechanic
            constructed it.<br> Back then, people only carried out calculations to 6 decimal places but the Difference Engine carried calculations out to 20 - 30 decimal calculations. The digits and decimals are represented by positions on toothed wheels,
            rather than the binary digits. When one of the toothed wheels turned from 9 to 0, it caused the next wheel to advance one position, carrying the digit.
