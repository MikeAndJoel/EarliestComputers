                  The Antikythera Mechanism was in a ship which is assumed to be Ancient Greek and, when it sank just off the coast of Antikythera island in the middle of the 1st century BCE it
                  carried a huge number of artefacts dating back to as early as the 4th century BCE. The mechanism was ignored even when someone saw a gear on it. It was ignored because people didn't think that technology from 2000 years ago would be possible to exist.

               Pascaline, also called Arithmetic Machine, the first calculator or adding machine to be produced in 
               <br>any quantity and actually used. The Pascaline was designed and built by the French mathematician
               <br>-philosopher Blaise Pascal between 1642 and 1644. It could only do addition and subtraction, with
               <br>numbers being entered by manipulating its dials. Pascal invented the machine for his father, a tax
               <br>collector, so it was the first business machine too. 
               <br>He built 50 of them over the next 10 years.
