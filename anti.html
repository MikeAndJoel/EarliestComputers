                  The Antikythera Mechanism was in a ship which is assumed to be Ancient Greek and, when it sank just off the coast of Antikythera island in the middle of the 1st century BCE it

                  <br>carried a huge number of artefacts dating back to as early as the 4th century BCE. The mechanism was ignored even when someone saw a gear on it. It was ignored because people didn't think that technology from 2000 years ago would

                  <br>be possible to exist. The mechanism consist of at least 30 bronze gears in a wooden container that was only the size of a shoebox, the clockwork mechanism was highly advanced for its time. By turning a hand-crank, the user could
                  move
                  <br>forward or backward in time. The crank made the gears move and rotate a series of dials and rings on which there are inscriptions and annotations of Greek zodiac signs and Egyptian calendar days. It seems that the information to
                  build
                  <br>such a mechanism was lost through time, perhaps because it was a specialty device or expensive to create. Similar astronomical clocks didn't reappear in Europe until the 14th century. Since inventions like this do not usually come
                  from nothing, though, many researchers think that we may yet find older precursors in an archaeological context some day.
